## Welcome to the **DEEPSPACE**!
DEEPSPACE is a blockchain-based open-world space game that went live with our minimum viable product on BSC (BNB) chain at the end of June 2022. You can explore the planetary system with your NFT spaceship fleet to discover rare resources, evade pirates, engage in wagered grid-based combat, race, and much, much more. The project was initially launched in Mid-2021 with the DPS token and was created based on the need for a game with a team that prioritizes the entertainment and sustainability aspects of gaming. Our core theme is that for a game to be successful and sustainable, it needs to be FUN – as that drives economic stability, player progression and character achievement. DEEPSPACE is to act as an immersive open world that employs several layers of gaming – strategy and chance, aesthetics, story, and rewards. We want to meet standards set by not only the blockchain gaming sector, but the gaming sector as a whole.
